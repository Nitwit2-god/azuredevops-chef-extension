# Tasks
{: .no_toc :}

This section documents all of the tasks that are available in the Azure DevOps Chef Extension.

There are a greatly reduced number of tasks compared to previous versions of the extension. This is so that the 'Execution' tasks can provide access to the actual command so the appropriate options for you environment can be specified.

For more complex operations, such as the configuration of the Habitat signing keys or updating the version constraint for a cookbook on a Chef environment, there is the the Helpers task.

For details on how to migrate existing tasks in a pipeline using a older version of the extension please refer to the [Migration](/migration/) section of the documentation.
