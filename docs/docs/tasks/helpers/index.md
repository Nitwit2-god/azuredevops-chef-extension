# Helpers
{:.no_toc :}

Whilst the [Execute](tasks/execute.html) task allows access to the Chef components within a pipeline, this does not provide all of the operations that may need to be completed. Such things include:

 - Updating the version number in a cookbook
 - Writing out the Habitat signing keys

This is what the Helpers task is for, it is multi functional task that can be selected to achieve these operations.
